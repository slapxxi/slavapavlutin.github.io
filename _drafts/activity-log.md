# Activity Log

As usual, I stagnate because of some uknown to me reasons. I need to move forward. Instead, I'm consistently moving backwards. I need to devise some way to avoid procrastination and some way to achieve what I really want. If I want to become a great developer, then I must to aspire to it and not being afraid of everything that can obstruct me from achieving my goals. The time spent on fears could be spent on actually doing something useful for my career as a Rails developer.

Now I have a clear goal in my mind. Even though I have this goal in my mind, I cannot in fact move towards it because something hinders me. Some of my psychological problems arise and obstruct me from being a productive member of the ruby community. Nevertheless, I can make myself learn better only if I would give myself a hard time and go out my comfort zone.

I intend to write a simple web application to hone my skills. I also need to write something interesting in Ruby to really understand it, which also help me hone my skills.

## Making Good Habits

I need the starting point to make a first step toward making good habits which should provide me with a valid routine to follow.

I don't know what to start with. I have a mixed feelings about writing my own web application. I totally want to write it but there is something that prevents me from actually starting writing it. I guess it's because I'm afraid of failure and hard work. But in fact to become an excellent developer I should work hard and spend a huge amount of time actually writing code.

## Mastering Rails

Rails is a massive web framework oriented on experienced web developers. Beginners also can benefit from it but it requires them to spend a huge amount of time learning the internals of the framework. I also need to learn its internals if I want to master it. In addition, Rails internals can show me various useful Ruby techniques experienced programmers use in their daily writing.

Mastering Rails is a long way on the course of which I would have to use all my energy and devotion to learning every bit of Rails architecture and capabilities.

The main purpose of learning Rails is being able to develop web applications with ease. Learning Rails for the sake of learning only can lead me to the moment when I know a lot but can't apply my knowledge. This would be stupid and unreasonable not to learn Rails through practice sessions. In other words, to start learning Rails I need to make a goal of developing some kind of an application and not learning the specific parts of Rails without knowing that I really need to learn them in order to develop the application I want.

I can title this writing as "My Adventures with Rails". I like it.

## Mastering Ruby

I want to master Ruby because I consider it the best programming language available for my development. The motto of Ruby fits my mindset perfectly.

## Writing a Lot

I really want to write a lot in English, but the lack of knowledge hinders me from writing every single day.

### Extending Vocabulary

Extending vocabulary each day can help me gain confidence in my knowledge and also vary the language I use in my writing.
