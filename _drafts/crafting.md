# Crafting Writing Skills

## Reading for Writing

> Think, too, about your notebook. It is important. This is your equipment, like hammer and nails to a carpenter. (Feel fortunateâ€”for very little money you are in business!) Sometimes people buy expensive hardcover journals. They are bulky and heavy, and because they are fancy, you are compelled to write something good. Instead you should feel that you have permission to write the worst junk in the world and it would be okay. Give yourself a lot of space in which to explore writing. A cheap spiral notebook lets you feel that you can fill it quickly and afford another. Also, it is easy to carry. (I often buy notebook-size purses.)
