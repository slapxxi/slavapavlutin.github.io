# Clear Code with Ruby

Clear code conveys its purpose.

Clear code matters because in the long term it makes development process much easier and more convenient for all the participants.

Writing clear code is a skill attained through numerous hours of practice with refactoring and making your intentions clear.

Clear code leads to clear thinking and it's very important to you as a developer.

I want to write clear code because I think that clear code is what makes programming similar to craftsmanship. In other words, crafting clear code is a valuable skill that comes in handy when it's needed to develop working yet extendable software.

Clear code is actually clear thinking. When you can see clearly what your code does right now, what features you can get rid of, what feature are not worth the maintenance, when your code is clear and you can eventually say that your design is good.

Clear code is not like clean code at all. Your code could be clean but in the end it's worth can be equal zero because it does nothing useful actually even though it's clean and reads well. To write clear code, you first of all should think clearly through your objectives, your intentions. Your most important goal is get to the essence of your application and your code.

Key words: essence, clarity, features you actually need right now (not in the future).

How to write clear code from day one. Independent practices that lead to better software. Some well-known programmers have already invented some rules and guidance over writing good software that get things done.

## Clear Code

To write clear code we need to think clearly all the time. It seems impossible and it is, in fact, impossible, to be in this neat and comfortable state of full understanding of the system under development. However, we don't have to think cleary all the time. What matters is a gradual clarification.

## Features

The features of the project under development lead its design. Without features we can't devise any kind of even the simplest design.

## Implementing Features

Let's write some code to demonstrate how clear code leads to excellent results.

## The Interface

The concept of an interface is very important to writing clear code. An interface is, as in actual definition, a medium between the user and the features of the system.
