# Clear Code

Here I'm going to write about clear code and what it really means for code to be clear, not clean.

Clear code conveys its purpose easily and without any distractions.

Clear code is reliant upon your best qualities to make it happen.

Writing for me is all about collecting and shaping ideas into something that could be useful to others.

I want to write clear code because I think that clear code is what makes programming similar to craftsmanship. In other words, crafting clear code is a valuable skill that comes in handy when it's needed to develop working yet extendable software.

Clear code is actually clear thinking. When you can see clearly what your code does right now, what features you can get rid of, what feature are not worth the maintenance, when your code is clear and you can eventually say that your design is good.

Clear code is not like clean code at all. Your code could be clean but in the end it's worth can be equal zero because it does nothing useful actually even though it's clean and reads well. To write clear code, you first of all should think clearly through your objectives, your intentions. Your most important goal is get to the essence of your application and your code.

Key words: essence, clarity, features you actually need right now (not in the future).

How to write clear code from day one. Independent practices that lead to better software. Some well-known programmers have already invented some rules and guidance over writing good software that get things done.
