# Mastering Ruby


But to do it every single day I need to find interest in it. Otherwise, I risk to lose early and give up all my dreams. What are my dreams, by the way?

## Ruby Documentation

Documentation is, in fact, the least effective and interesting way to learn something. Perhaps, I lied about effectivenes but definetely not about whether it's interesting to learn something through documentation.

Ruby documentation should be read as a good textbook not as a collection of arbitrary articles on Ruby. In other words, we should struggle to make Ruby documentation more beginner-oriented. Maybe, it'd be reasonable to make an external web site oriented on people learning Ruby.

I want to make my documentation more tutorial-oriented, so to speak.
