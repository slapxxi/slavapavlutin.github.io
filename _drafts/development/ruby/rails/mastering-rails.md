# How to Learn Rails?

There are a lot of steps involved in learning Rails to the degree where you can develop and maintain the applications you want. In other words, to learn Rails you ought to work really hard.

There are many steps that can help me learn Rails effectively. Let's define them here.

1. Develop applications on a daily basis. As with writing, in programming to become an expert I have to devote every single day to development. I have to focus on writing and testing code every day to get most out of it.

2. __Read the source__. There are many open source projects of high quality which can help me understand better how things work in web development. I should read a lot of others' code in order to learn effectively.

3. Start with small applicaitons. There's no point in getting out of your skin to develop the next massive hot web application everybody will love. Start with small projects that can please you and make your life a little bit easier.

4. Help others learn. Learning by itself is boosted by helping and teaching others. Don't underestimate the power of teaching in learning effectiveness.

Rails is a massive web framework aimed at experienced web developers. Beginners also can benefit from it but it requires them to spend a huge amount of time learning the internals of the framework. I also need to learn its internals if I want to master it. In addition, Rails internals can show me various useful Ruby techniques experienced programmers use in their daily writing.

Mastering Rails is a long way on the course of which I would have to use all my energy and devotion to learning every bit of Rails architecture and capabilities.

The main purpose of learning Rails is being able to develop web applications with ease. Learning Rails for the sake of learning only can lead me to the moment when I know a lot but can't apply my knowledge. This would be stupid and unreasonable not to learn Rails through practice sessions. In other words, to start learning Rails I need to make a goal of developing some kind of an application and not learning the specific parts of Rails without knowing that I really need to learn them in order to develop the application I want.

I can title this writing as "My Adventures with Rails". I like it.

## Starting with Something Small or Even Tiny

When you start learning something, it's important to understand that you should make progress constantly and in small steps. It's important because it allows you to carefully analyze your action and its consequences. It also important because it allows to emphasize the quality of learning over quantity. For learning to be effective you need to pay attention to what relevant and ignore the other.

That's why I should start with developing tiny applications with Rails. Later, I can proceed to something very big and more beneficial, but in the beginning it's better to postpone your ambitions and understand that everything you learn is worth it no matter how small the results of learning could appear.

I need to write something daily and the more I write, the better. That's why I should create the folder for regular drafting and writing and post to it daily, no matter how small my posts actually are. For convenience, I can divide my writing into topics and write about these topics to be more focused and productive. Even though everyday writing can suffice on its own, it's better to pay attention to writing something that really matters and extract the essence of your current mind state.
