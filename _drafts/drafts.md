Writing is hard.

Learning is hard work. The learning process.

Organize my thinking into topics to write about in more details.

Too much knowledge hinders productivity.

I avoid working a lot because I'm afraid of failing to achieve perfect results for the first time even though I know that's perfectionism in fact hinders my productivity.

I want to write a little application to practice my skills in Ruby and Rails development. The eventual goal is to become a professional Ruby/Rails developer.

I want to communicate with many people in Ruby community to help them and myself learn and developer better. I also want to make Ruby a better language and its community better as well.

My attempts at introspection and self-analysis.

I doubt today is the day everything changed. I tend to make the same mistakes over and over again. I think I won't ever become someone who can be praised or admired for his achievements.

Perhaps, my doubts are the source of my numerous failures in everything I want to accomplish. I should not hesitate. Instead I should act right now. I should focus on the things that are important to me and have some value at least in the near future. Ignoring my desires would be as promising as avoiding too much thinking and reasoning about the genuine values I aspire to.

I'm not sure how to write and what to write about, yet I want to write a lot. How can I achieve the better results now? How can I develop software and write regularly? I need some topics to write about and some personal projects to practice my coding skills.

It's easy to create a basic project to code something into it, yet it's still required to write about something. I want to write about clean code, software development, personal achievements, and happiness.

I want to write about the future and the existing now.

I want to write so much that everyone who reads my writing can say that I'm a prolific author. I want to become a prolific author.

Every single sentence has to be connected with some other sentence in order for my writing to be coherent and interesting to read.

I write so little because I don't know English very well. In addition, my daily writing is constrained by writing some nonsense staff no one will ever read. Hence, I need to write more and better for a limited time. I need to write tons of cool stuff and write about something that interests me.

I don't know now how to use most of the words I learn in my writing since I write not enough to use all of them. The obvious solution is to write a lot and try to exploit as many of the words as possible.

I can't use every single word I learn in my writing. I have to accept that and move along writing about things I care about using words and expressions I know. However, I need to devise some way to incorporate new words and knowledge into my writing. I can revise to do just that. I can revise my writing so that it could include more new expressions and words. It's not that difficult and also it also helps to separate two important processes. Here it comes the conclusion - focus is an important part of painless and successful learning, working, and life.

I want to become a productive programmer. I want to develop a lot of personal software projects as well as getting paid for programming and web development.

I want to communicate with numerous people involved in developing software and writing about it. I want to revolve around the community of professionals whose goals are similar to mine.
