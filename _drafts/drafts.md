# Drafts

It's time to finally choose a topic to write about. Let's think about it together. I can't even imagine a topic fitting into my unusual and full of flaws thinking. However, that I don't know what to write about yet doesn't mean I cannot write about something to my advantage. I can write for writing to serve a particular goal I want it to accomplish. First of all, then, I need to decide on what writing can really do for me and how it can enlighten my life.

First, writing can help me to avoid dull thinking and at the same time clarify it. In other words, prolific writing affect the way I think. In other words again, prolific writing really helps to articulate your feelings and make decisions wisely.

Let's write step by step. First let's write about a single topic I consider interesting. Perhaps, a single most important benefit of writing.

For me, the most important part of writing is the effect of clarifying my thoughts and feelings. When I write I can reduce ambiguity in my thinking and life. You see, most of the time I can't think clearly and this leads me to nothing interesting. I can do a lot things given the free time I've got but I spend it fruitlessly. That's the disadvantage of my lifestyle. I can use writing to clarify thinking and return to the path I've chosen to walk along.

Everything worth achieving is hard actually. It doesn't mean, however, that it should not be followed by the following practices.

Anyway, I love the writing process so much as I hate realizing that my writing sucks. Actually, the idea that my writing sucks and would suck for a long time impedes my progress.

Too much knowledge hinders productivity.

I avoid working a lot because I'm afraid of failing to achieve perfect results for the first time even though I know that's perfectionism in fact hinders my productivity.

I want to write a little application to practice my skills in Ruby and Rails development. The eventual goal is to become a professional Ruby/Rails developer.

I want to communicate with many people in Ruby community to help them and myself learn and developer better. I also want to make Ruby a better language and its community better as well.

My attempts at introspection and self-analysis.

I doubt today is the day everything changed. I tend to make the same mistakes over and over again. I think I won't ever become someone who can be praised or admired for his achievements.

Perhaps, my doubts are the source of my numerous failures in everything I want to accomplish. I should not hesitate. Instead I should act right now. I should focus on the things that are important to me and have some value at least in the near future. Ignoring my desires would be as promising as avoiding too much thinking and reasoning about the genuine values I aspire to.

I want to write about the future and the existing now.

I want to become a productive programmer. I want to develop a lot of personal software projects as well as getting paid for programming and web development.

I want to communicate with numerous people involved in developing software and writing about it. I want to revolve around the community of professionals whose goals are similar to mine.

I want to become a famous web developer but I don't know how to start actually. In fact, I know how to start but I tend to procrastinate instead of doing somethign actually useful for achieving my objectives.

## The Result of Extensive Knowledge

> The less you know, the better you sleep.

## Effective Learning

Learning is hard work. The learning process.

I need to describe my approach to effective learning here if I want enhance it.

I want to learn something new every single day but... There is always something that hinders me from accomplishing anything valuable and I keep stagnating.

It's a slippery slap path to achieve being an active Rails developer in a matter of a month. Actually, learning Ruby and Rails can boost your career and change your life to better.

I've already defined the way to write here. First of all I write down an essay of so many words as I can. Then I rewrite it to make it sound, be read, and look as clearly and natively as possible.

Writing is a lot of fun, actually. The truth is that it's difficult enough to scare and intimidate novice authors, but the outcome is much worth the effort and the feeling of achievement can actually spark your productivity and creative thinking.

The most difficult part of being an author is making habits. You need to write every single day to become a really successful author. When I say about being successful, I mean that you write something that really makes you proud and happy about being an active person.

If you don't want to waste your life being a consumer who knows nothing except taking and not giving, then you totally should try to write each day and see where it will lead you. Active writing life can, in fact, lead you to many interesting events. You can meet new people, get a new job, and feel that you're helping other people to become better. It's what makes your brain enjoy your life and trigger specific neurons responsible for taking pleasure from what you're doing.

## My Wishes

What I really wish to accomplish? I don't really know whether I want to develop applications or all I need is to just earn some money and spend them on some stuff. It appears that recently I have no desire for learning and achieving anything. All I need now is to spend some time on gaming and watching movies. The rest is for dreaming and not considering my future connected to it.

If I want to be a programmer, then I need to spend a lot of time learning and reading.

If I want to be a writer, then I need to spend a lot of time writing and thinking about stuff.

It seems I don't want both now. I don't want anything at all. I don't know why but now I feel empty and crambled. I don't even want to spend my energy at all. I just want to die miserably.

Such pathetic thoughts and feelings frighten me, but I don't see an immediate solution or a life-long one. I just want to give up and do nothing at all. I don't want to learn. I don't want to think. I don't want to do anything at all. I just want to do nothing and be nothing. I need some rewards that will pull me out of this abyss of stagnacy.

I even hate my writing since it's so dumb. It annoys me that I don't know anything to write fluently even though I want to write well. How can I learn enough of words to write at least something that will keep me alive for a long time.

I'd like to develop an application in Rails or Ruby? I don't want it at all. I don't know what I want now because life seems to be so empty and pointless. I can't even make myself read a chapter of some book or learn something new. All I do now is wining about my futile life full of miserable actions and nonsense emotions. What can pull me out? What can save me from being a mediocre person who knows nothing and can nothing. What is my life and where does it go?

It sucks to be me because I spend so much time doing nothing that I could barely achieve anything that I can be proud of. However, writing regularly should help me think better and enjoy my life.
