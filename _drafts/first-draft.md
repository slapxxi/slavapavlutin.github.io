## Writing Experience

Just one day from my writing experience.

There are numerous ways to improve my writing.

- Make writing a habit
- Read a lot of good writing
- Read about good writing

Writing is hard as anything else worth doing. Through the recent experience with designing and developing a simple website I realized that even the skills that appear to be simple and straightforward could be, as any other kinds of skills, time-consuming and exhausting.

My goal is not to write a lot. My goal is to write and think clearly. The main benefit from writing to me is that it makes thinking and reasoning more clear and tangible. I'd rather feel myself thinking and living my life than waste my time going circles even though I subconsciously understand that I'm doing something wrong.

I don't know the bulletproof way to become a successful writer. I think actually nobody knows it. However, I know the way to become better over time. It's regular practice. I know why I don't get better at writing. It's because I don't write enough to make a significant shift in my writing skills. I need to establish a daily routine to facilitate my learning.

Honesty is one of the pivotal principles of good writing. You see, to be honest means to be open-hearted and telling what you really think about what you and only you really experienced in your life. You can't be honest and talk about general things. It's just an objective truth everybody knows. There's nothing interesting in that.

In fact, writing is similar to other creative endeavors. You always start with something vague and shitty. There are little chances that you will start good and will be good along all the way. There's miserable chance that it happens. It requires enormous experience and luck. Chances are, however, that you start with something unclear, something shitty that you gradually makes better and better until you're done and happy with it. It's how creativity in general works.



## Benefits of Writing to Me

Oh, Gee. How badly I missed writing. It's like divine presence right upfront me. I feel newborn. I feel that my mind juices are flowing again.

The most important skill in our century appears to be the skill of expressing your thoughts clearly.
It can be acquired through regular writing practice.

I want to tell you the truth about writing that could make you say A-ha! Writing is damn difficult. No wonder that your numerous attempt to write failed. However, even though you. (Don't forget about shitty first drafts.) Let it go. Let your shitty thoughts and insights jump out of your stupid head. Otherwise, you won't change. You won't stop to be stupid. Start changing things with small steps and make these steps regularly so that those tiny steps constitute a long path to success.

I don't know what to write about. Nobody knows from the start what they want to write about. They just write what comes to head and then cherry-pick whatever is not grouse.

I've been practicing for only about half an hour and I've already can see some immediate benefits. I know if I will make a habit of writing, it will be pretty damn difficult to live without it even for a single day until the moment I stop the regrets stop.

**When writing I can touch my thoughts and see my reflection on paper.**
