Here I'm going to write about something that reflects on my own knowledge and skills. What I really want is to improve my thinking and communicating skills through regular writing practice. It requires everyday diligence and effort to maintain a constant amount of writing as long as every single day of your life. However, any kind of writing seems very interesting to me and very intriguing due to its reflecting qualities. I can analyze my writing to better understand how I think and reason about things. By regular improvement of my writing I can achieve general improvement in my thinking as well. It demands a lot of energy and time. However, I want to achieve that goal.

Here I write down my insights and observations. I do it not only because I want to keep track of my thoughts, but also because I want to improve and hone my skills.

We can add value to our thoughts by adding bloated sentences and nerdy words. It, however, doesn't affect the way we think or solve problems. It only slightly cnahges our appearance.

It's fascinating that now my writing doesn't appear as bad as before. Now I'm able to construct grammatically correct sentences into meaningful paragraphs. It's amazing. I know that through plentiful of practice I can achieve great results and eventually become a great writer. It takes time but it's totally worth it. The foremost reason to write for me is a possibility to examine and improve my thinking over a short period of time.
