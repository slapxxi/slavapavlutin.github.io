# Everyday Writing

My problem is that I do not try very hard to start making useful habits one by one. I deal with it at the same time and pay the price, which is an inability to make changes in my life. I need to start making changes one by one, small step by another small step. This should help me acquire what I want. Now I want to write every single day of my life to not the valuable moments and thoughts slip out of my vision. I want to preserve and enhance my thinking. To get used to writing, however, I need to write continuously in a week or so. That should make this habit possible.

Everyday writing has its goal, otherwise it would be pointless to waste my precious time on it. What's the point of writing then? I need to determine the point of writing for me, not for everyone. Why I need to write?
