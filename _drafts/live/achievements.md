## What I want to be?

First, I want to write a lot because writing encourage thinking carefully. Without writing our lives are moving to fast by us, leading us nowhere blindly. I want to control my mind and be a master of my thinking. I don't want to be a victim of chaos brough to this world by universe.

Until I'm doing it every day I cannot consider myself a productive programmer or a prolific author. Being productive means a lot in fact. Productive people tend to achieve better results in everything they do. I want to be such a guy.

Attention! I need to do it EVERY SINGLE DAY because there's no other way to become an expert writer or programmer.

## Something is better than nothing

Doing somethign even if it seems useless or futile is better than doing nothing at all. Procrastinations never helps achieve anything.
