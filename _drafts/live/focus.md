# Focus

To enjoy live, I need to be able to focus on what's important to me. It allows to see the essence of things. And the essence is very important to almost everything you can touch or feel.

For some people focusing on things could be difficult because of their attitude towards approaching their lives and tasks they try to accomplish. However, focusing helps realize what you are doing and why you are doing it. The very effective combination would be adding focusing to reviewing things to make your process a slightly better next time. This way you can enable the most effective of your working and learning processes.

I want to focus more often on things that's important to me but something prevents me from achieving this deceptively simple goal. There are many distractions on my way. In addition, once I start focusing I feel that it's whether too difficult or too simple to pay attention to it at all. However, if I actually accomplished the task behind the focus, I feel much better and feel that I actually are moving in some direction and getting closer to what I really want to get from misery looking, at the moment, life.

## Interceptions or Distractions (To Put It Another Way)

No matter what joy and pleasure the feeling of achievement something purposeful brings to me, there are other things that also please me but in fact distract me from spending time productively. One of these distractions is gaming. Gaming really helps me to avoid over-working but leads to stagnation and too long sessions of procrastions which can long for days or even weeks. I don't need to get rid of them, but I need to spend much less time to resting this way because sometimes it could lead me to the worst where I can blame myself for being inactive and can procrastinate even more in this phase of complaining about myself and the way I live my life.

I do actually like spending time beneficially but I also like to do nothing and enjoy life in its simplest form - doing nothing at all and watching myself being a typical man who know no regret about the decisions he makes.

## The Rest

In trying to stretch yourself out at your max, you can forget about the rest and keep going increasing the chance of the burnout. Your actual goal is to keep getting better without risking to burnout early or risking to burnout at all. Your main priority is to keep improving your situtation without a risk to lose your achievements. It means that your need to keep moving at the comfortable to you pace making small (or even tiny) steps toward your goals. Do not forget to take a rest. Otherwise, you risk to lose too much of your efforts. My experience actually told me that.

Let me step aside our current investigation over the ins and outs of focusing on important and let me focus (oh, irony) on something even more interesting - the way you live your life.
