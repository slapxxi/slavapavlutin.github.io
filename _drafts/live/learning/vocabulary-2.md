## Quotes

> *Virtually* all web applications require a login and authentication system of some sort. As a result, most web frameworks have a *plethora* of options for implementing such systems, and Rails is no exception. Are you suffering from an *excess* of stress in your life?

> Active Record comes with a *host* of methods for creating, saving, and finding data objects, all without having to use the Structured Query Language (SQL) used by relational databases.

> The effect is that Rails *insulates* you almost entirely from the details of the data store. He tried to protect Kelly from the attack.

> It is, to put it *mildly*, very compact. *Oddly*, destroy, like create, returns the object in question, though I can’t recall ever having used the return value of destroy. Even odder, perhaps, is that the destroyed object still exists in memory.

> Our validations for the name attribute enforce only minimal constraints — any non-blank name under 51 characters will do — but of course the email attribute must satisfy more *stringent* requirements.

> Adding this index on the email attribute accomplishes a second goal, *alluded* to briefly in Section 6.1.4: it fixes an efficiency problem in find_by.

> This behavior is *governed* by the config.cache_classes setting.

> The fastest solution to this problem in Ruby is usually to *forgo* a holding array and *tack* the substrings directly onto a base string.

> It might be *picky* and reject your value altogether by raising an ArgumentError.

> The woman in front of the researchers today, however, was lean and *vibrant*, with the toned legs of a runner. For the past three years, they had *poked* and *prodded* Lisa and more than two dozen other former smokers, chronic overeaters, problem drinkers, obsessive shopers, and people with other destructive habits.
