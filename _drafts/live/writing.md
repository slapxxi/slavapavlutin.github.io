# On Writing

I want to write a lot and write fluently but my writing seems such a waste that I want to give up immediately. What can I do about that? Actually, I can do everything that can help me overcome this attitude and start gaining some results from my life.

## To Write a Lot I need to Read a lot

Writing of others helps me shape my thinking and better understand how other people think while writing, how they produce ideas, and what they write about in essence.

## The Essence - The most important thing about something

I should focus on the essence of my life. In other words, I should pay attention only to what really matters. To identify what matters to me, however, I need to write and think a lot.

## Organize your life thus organizing your thinking and vice versa

There is a lot of chaos in my life now and I don't enjoy this state of affairs. I prefer being in charge not being leaded to nowhere by futile habits.

Anyway, I love the writing process so much as I hate realizing that my writing sucks. Actually, the idea that my writing sucks and would suck for a long time impedes my progress.

For me, the most important part of writing is the effect of clarifying my thoughts and feelings. When I write I can reduce ambiguity in my thinking and life. You see, most of the time I can't think clearly and this leads me to nothing interesting. I can do a lot things given the free time I've got but I spend it fruitlessly. That's the disadvantage of my lifestyle. I can use writing to clarify thinking and return to the path I've chosen to walk along.

First, writing can help me to avoid dull thinking and at the same time clarify it. In other words, prolific writing affect the way I think. In other words again, prolific writing really helps to articulate your feelings and make decisions wisely.

Let's write step by step. First let's write about a single topic I consider interesting. Perhaps, a single most important benefit of writing.

There are numerous topics to write about. I dare to say that there are infinite number of topics actually. However, to be an prolific author, I need to pick a topic of interest and write about it exclusively for a limited time. Later on, I can switch topics easily, but not being able to choose one among various is a problem that leads to procrastination and reduced productivity.

If I want to write a lot, I need to choose now and keep writing until I'm out of ideas for my writing. Until then, it's pointless to give up writing about a particular topic because that could lead me astray.

It's time to finally choose a topic to write about. Let's think about it together. I can't even imagine a topic fitting into my unusual and full of flaws thinking. However, that I don't know what to write about yet doesn't mean I cannot write about something to my advantage. I can write for writing to serve a particular goal I want it to accomplish. First of all, then, I need to decide on what writing can really do for me and how it can enlighten my life.

## Writing is Hard

Writing is hard because it utilizes most of our thinking tools to get words on paper.

If what you're doing is hard, then probably you're taking right actions.

I want to write a lot for a reason. It's up to me to figure out for what reasons in fact I want to write.

How to write? It's dead simple. Start putting words on paper and watch your real thinking emerge.

I'm not sure how to write and what to write about, yet I want to write a lot. How can I achieve the better results now? How can I develop software and write regularly? I need some topics to write about and some personal projects to practice my coding skills.

What to write about? There definitely are some topics you will write about instead of other topics. So, basically, the main goal is to identify such topics and later extend on them.

## How to write a lot?

I want to write about clean code, software development, personal achievements, and happiness.

I write so little because I don't know English very well. In addition, my daily writing is constrained by writing some nonsense staff no one will ever read. Hence, I need to write more and better for a limited time. I need to write tons of cool stuff and write about something that interests me.

I don't know now how to use most of the words I learn in my writing since I write not enough to use all of them. The obvious solution is to write a lot and try to exploit as many of the words as possible.

I can't use every single word I learn in my writing. I have to accept that and move along writing about things I care about using words and expressions I know. However, I need to devise some way to incorporate new words and knowledge into my writing. I can revise to do just that. I can revise my writing so that it could include more new expressions and words. It's not that difficult and also it also helps to separate two important processes. Here it comes the conclusion - focus is an important part of painless and successful learning, working, and life.

## Writing & Thinking

Writing is thinking. It's, in fact, just another form of thinking and in fact it's even more creative and effective than plain old inward thinking.

My thinking degrades constantly. I write too little to assert that I'm making any kind of progress toward better thinking and learning. I cannot assess my current skills because I didn't create anything valuable in recent years. In fact, I didn't write or develop anything valuable at all. The only way to change this is to keep learning and practicing, avoiding common pitfalls such as procrastinating or paying attention to irrelevant things.

## Rewriting

I can't assert whether rewriting will help me write or learn better because I haven't actually tried it yet. First of all, then, I need to give rewriting a chance to prove its credibility or uselessness.

To rewrite a lot, however, one need to write a lot. To keep things simple I can start with writing and later rewriting a little. It should help me avoid overwhelming and giving up it altogether.

## Polishing Writing

How can I improve my writing step by step? Here is the list of the supposed ways to improve and enhance my writing skills.

* _Increase vocabulary_. To write fluently I need an impressive vocabulary on my side to successfully turn my thoughts into English words.
* _Write every single day_. No matter how much I write, writing even the smallest amount can improve my skills slowly but consistently.
* _Rewrite as often as you write_. Rewriting, how many say, is an essence of writing. So, there's no real reason to avoid it.
* _Write for various reasons._ Writing for various reasons can flex my skills and widen and deepen my thinking.

## Writing Tools

Writing really helps me think more clearly even though I can't write very clearly yet. However, in most cases even subtle clarification can boost my productivity.
