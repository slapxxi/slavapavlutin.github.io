# Day Four

I write to clarify my thinking. Without writing my thoughts tend to be muddy and entangled by daily routine. In the course of the day I think about tons of things, but only few of them are actually relevant to my happiness and well-being. I'm here to figure out what is important to me and what I want to do and to be.

Every single piece of writing need coherence in order to provide the audience with great reading experience. However, no need to strive for coherence in the beginning of the writing process. First of all, I need to figure out what I'm trying to say and what I actually think. I need to be able to write clearly what I sincerely think. Only after done with this preliminary stage, I should move on to editing my writing so that the audience could easily understand it.

I want to be a creative person. The one who spends all his free time on creating something, be it writing, coding, or designing. I want to create and make a living with it.

I will continue this essay later next day... Stick around, my mind, don't let yourself be captivated by meaningless activities such as playing Hearthstone or watching "How I Met Your Mother". Good luck.

I miserably failed to not let my mind wander last night. Too bad. Today I will try harder.
