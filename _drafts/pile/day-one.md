# Day One

There are many important things to write about, but I don't want to write about important stuff. I don't want about specific topics either. All I want is to be honest to myself, to write down what I really think, and what I really care about. I think this is a very important to keep in mind while writing. Don't try to impress someone who maybe doesn't even exist.

The second most important thing to keep in mind is that the inner censor should go as far as possible. There's no point in trying write a perfect something. That's not the true point of writing. The point of writing is in seeking yourself. Writing helps to better understand the world outside and inside us.

There's no way to avoid working hard to achieve writing success. I need to write down tons of pages. Tons of pages. I have to write, edit, write again. And so on, and so on.

Writing about the same topic over and over again is not as much helpful as a diversity of topics and ways to write about. It's an interesting idea, actually. I want to write aboud a diversity of topics, but I don't have any ideas. I know that I can write about any possible topic but it's difficult to imagine what exactly to write because I have to general topics in mind. First of all, I need to narrow down to several interesting topics. I can make notes on iPad to do just that. Easy.

The second way to make ideas about writing topics is to write more and review my writing for possible specific things to write about.
