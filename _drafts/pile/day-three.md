# Day Three

To become a successful writer I need to write. So here I am. Perhaps, I am a little obsessed with the idea of being great so that I can't really start to enjoy the process. I should relax a little and focus on my feelings and ideas. True story.

Here I am, sitting in front of my computer and waiting for inspiration to strike. I'm drinking a lot of fluids otherwise feel thirsty. I'm always thirsty. I always need something to happen inside and around. If not, I tend to waste time on gaming, watching series, and eating a lot of candies. I'm not a master of writing but crave to be one.

This first draft is invaluable because it allows me to write everything I want wihout an afraid of looking stupid or silly. Writing to me is the most difficult in the world right now. I practically have no experience in it and won't have in the near future as well. I want to be a good writer. But one could become such an effective so that it's writing is easy and fluent. I don't really know. I guess the only way is to write a freaking lot. Write about everything and in any form. I will always remember that as I'm writing the clarity is coming. I strive for clarity. I need to think clearly. I really need it. I'm afraid of living the muddy life which I can't understand.

It's just the third day of my writing practice. Even now I want to write fluently although I do understand it's impossible due to my little experience. There are, however, numerous ways to improve my skills. One of them is writing every single day.

The other way to improve my writing is to focus on something specific and writing about it exclusively. Software design, for instance. I can focus all my mental power on thinking about this topic and writing all my ideas, experience, and knowledge down along with clarifying my thinking.

Whenever I read about something I know very well, I think that the author tells me too obvious things to consider. On my side, however, it would be great to try to write about all those things myself so that I can see my thinking on paper.

What muddy writing fails to achieve is clarity and simplicity. I can't stand reading something pompous. It distracts me from the ideas, from the author's honest opinion on the subject matter.
