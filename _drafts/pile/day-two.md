# Day Two

Is writing that difficult so I cannot start with simple and elegant solutions. I can write about anything. So, let's choose from the topics I care about. The beauty of writing is in the process. Doing writing your thinking clarifies and gets cleaner and better. I want to be a good and effective thinker. That's why I choose writing as the most important skill in my skill-set. I want to think clearer, I want to understand my feelings and surroundings better. I want to understand things better. I want to understand myself better. I want to make my writing as clear and transparent as possible. I need to strive for better writing. I know I can write better. To write better all I need is write every single day. Every single day counts. Even more, every single paragraph, sentence, and word written with something specific in mind counts.

Focused writing. The most basic thing I understand about my writing skills is that I can use writing practice to write about something specific and try to keep track on this as long as possible. It's definitely easy to write in a native language but I want to write in a foreign language and that makes my attempts difficult. However, with enough effort and desire I can achieve everythign I truly want. And I'm here to understand what I really want, to clarify my thinking and feelings.
