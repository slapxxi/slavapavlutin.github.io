# The Stack

## English

I want to write in English exclusively but there is a problem - my English sucks.  It's true that I can produce understandable writing but I lack practice that makes perfect, or at least well. Until I embrace an everyday practice of writing my Enlish will be suck.

Despite that I want to write in English a lot, my English is not good enough for this purpose. However, I can write with mistakes and decent vocabulary. This at least can help me boost my learning and hence provide me with knowledge I need to improve my writing.

## Learning

You should apply new knowledge immediately. If you don't, it will soon become tedious to repeat the same actions over and over again just for the sake of memorizing something or trying to learn something without actually learning something. Learning, in its simplest form, is acquiring knowledge that you can apply in your life so that it's easier or possible to do something. That's why it's important to find an application to your knowledge as soon as possible. If you learn foreign words, the possible application would be using them in your writing pretty damn immediately so that you can feel that you've achieved something valuable and gained some knowledge, which in addition is useful.

## Habits

Any habit comes with a set of supporting habits which are the part of the main habit being acquired. To acquire a habit effectively, one should focus on various additions to the habit. If I want to make a habit of everyday fitness I also have to spend time on making other habits supporting the main habit. I need to keep gathering ideas if I want to write enough. I prefer writing in small cycles. Any cycle consists of four steps. The first step is to write as much as possible for a given time and to write down as many ideas as you have. The second step is read through your rough draft and extract the most interesting parts. The third step is to divide your draft into the parts related to the excerpts you've made. Finally, the last and the fourth step is to rewrite your first draft so that it could reflect on your new insights.

## Writing

I noticed that I use the same written form over and over again. It's because I lack diversity in my writing and also because of my modest vocabulary and skill in English writing. However, I can change it. All I need to do is to write as often and as much as I can. Also, I can remind myself about grammar rules and vocabulary by learning a lot as well.

The recipe of great writing is this - to write *well* write a lot. Since writing is just a craft the mastery at which is gained by regular practice. Writing is a craft, basically. Proficiency at any craft is gained by constant and regular practice.

The golden secret of writing lies behind the anatomy of the brain. To write well one needs to write about interesting topics a lot.

The obvious bad thing with my writing is that it's mostly pointless and disoriented. In other words, I need a topic to write about. I need a goal to achieve. I need something that will make me grow quick. If I have too much material, I have to edit to the bare bones in order to get rid of anything irrelevant. To put it simply, I have to focus on writing about a specific topic to make most out of my writing. But what to do when I don't know what to write. Then just start writing until it appears in your first draft. The first draft is the most versatile moment in the process of writing. All I need is to keep writing until I find the idea that's of particular interest to me and my readers. However, it's not an easy attempt. I have to spend a considerable amount of time and energy on just writing something that don't change anything. But it's the point of the first draft. The point is to figure out what you *need* to write down.

Writing is an act of revelation. Writing liberates you from the limitations of your thinking routine. On paper one might preserve any single thought he has.

Writing can help me describe my experience. It works only if I have a great deal of experience.

I need to focus on writing well or writing to describe my experience. Writing brings amusement to my life. When you write, you actually see more and see it more clearly as well. I want to write not because I want to impress others. More importantly, I write to clarify my thinking, get more insights, and understand the world around me. I don't want to write for the sake of writing. But there's nothing wrong with this aspiration if you know that the writing itself can bring a lot of value to your life.

There are a number of topics I can write about. For the first attempt to write something I can choose any topic I want and try to describe it in as many details as I can imagine. It's just the first step of writing well. Making a habit of writing is a major first step in any successful writing career.

Let me tell a bit about rewriting and its role in writing in general. Rewriting is a crucial part of writing. It makes your writing better every time you do it. In consequence, the more you rewrite, the better your writing.

## Creativity

Great ideas won't come easily. In order to catch them, I need to go through garbage of useless and pointless ideas which purpose is to lead me to the ideas that are worth attention and the detailed overview.

I always think about some lousy stuff that won't change my life. I can write about it in order to clarify what's happening in my mind. It's time to get used to writing a lot. The only way to write a lot is not to be afraid of accepting that your thoughts and ideas sucks, and not to be afraid of writing them down in a very detailed manner.

## Reading

In addition to working a lot, in order to learn more I also need to read a lot.

I can read only what I really like. I like reading because it's very easy in contrast to writing. Reading and writing are similar in respect to both produce some knowledge and shape out your thinking.

There are tons of books on the market on any topic. That fact makes it even more important to satisfy my reading longing be reading what I like. In order to pick up the most interesting book I need to get through a lot of shit. This is work that has to be done.

Reading is about getting others' experience. When you read you have an access to the knowledge the author or authors acquired through the course of their lives. This way, reading allows us to gain experience by just taking glances over the books we read. It's a powerful way to acquire knowledge. It's a huge source of experience and knowledge about the topics hard to acquire on your own.
