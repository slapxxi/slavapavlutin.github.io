# Writing Experience

I'd like to describe my thoughts on writing and how it's done here. Writing is just a form of creativity. As a form of creativity, the writing process is determined by the individual who uses it.

First steps in writing. When I first sit down to write I something, I don't have a particular audience or particular topic in mind. All I do is try to write down some arbitrary thoughts coming in. After enough thoughts assembled I can choose exactly what ideas and insights are of some interest to me and continue writing specifically about them, collecting even more ideas and insights to later have enough material to compose a piece of writing for a particular audience in mind. However, the first step is to just collect a lot of ideas and thoughts on paper to choose what comes in and what comes out. Refining your writing is a step that's done much later in the workflow.
