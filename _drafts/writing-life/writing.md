# On Writing

## Writing is Hard

Writing is hard because it utilizes most of our thinking tools to get words on paper.

If what you're doing is hard, then probably you're taking right actions.

I want to write a lot for a reason. It's up to me to figure out for what reasons in fact I want to write.

How to write? It's dead simple. Start putting words on paper and watch your real thinking emerge.

I'm not sure how to write and what to write about, yet I want to write a lot. How can I achieve the better results now? How can I develop software and write regularly? I need some topics to write about and some personal projects to practice my coding skills.

What to write about? There definitely are some topics you will write about instead of other topics. So, basically, the main goal is to identify such topics and later extend on them.

How to write a lot?

I want to write about clean code, software development, personal achievements, and happiness.

I write so little because I don't know English very well. In addition, my daily writing is constrained by writing some nonsense staff no one will ever read. Hence, I need to write more and better for a limited time. I need to write tons of cool stuff and write about something that interests me.

I don't know now how to use most of the words I learn in my writing since I write not enough to use all of them. The obvious solution is to write a lot and try to exploit as many of the words as possible.

I can't use every single word I learn in my writing. I have to accept that and move along writing about things I care about using words and expressions I know. However, I need to devise some way to incorporate new words and knowledge into my writing. I can revise to do just that. I can revise my writing so that it could include more new expressions and words. It's not that difficult and also it also helps to separate two important processes. Here it comes the conclusion - focus is an important part of painless and successful learning, working, and life.

## Writing & Thinking

Writing is thinking. It's, in fact, just another form of thinking and in fact it's even more creative and effective than plain old inward thinking.

My thinking degrades constantly. I write too little to assert that I'm making any kind of progress toward better thinking and learning. I cannot assess my current skills because I didn't create anything valuable in recent years. In fact, I didn't write or develop anything valuable at all. The only way to change this is to keep learning and practicing, avoiding common pitfalls such as procrastinating or paying attention to irrelevant things.

## Rewriting

I can't assert whether rewriting will help me write or learn better because I haven't actually tried it yet. First of all, then, I need to give rewriting a chance to prove its credibility or uselessness.

To rewrite a lot, however, one need to write a lot. To keep things simple I can start with writing and later rewriting a little. It should help me avoid overwhelming and giving up it altogether.

## Polishing Writing

How can I improve my writing step by step? Here is the list of the supposed ways to improve and enhance my writing skills.

* _Increase vocabulary_. To write fluently I need an impressive vocabulary on my side to successfully turn my thoughts into English words.
* _Write every single day_. No matter how much I write, writing even the smallest amount can improve my skills slowly but consistently.
* _Rewrite as often as you write_. Rewriting, how many say, is an essence of writing. So, there's no real reason to avoid it.
* _Write for various reasons._ Writing for various reasons can flex my skills and widen and deepen my thinking.

## Writing Tools

Writing really helps me think more clearly even though I can't write very clearly yet. However, in most cases even subtle clarification can boost my productivity.
